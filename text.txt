REACT :

React is a  javascript library for building user interfaces, primarily maintained by meta(formerly facebook)
and a community of developers. It allows developers to build dynamic, responsive web applications efficiency.

Why React was Created ?

. React was created in 2011 by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. The primaty goal was to address
 issues with performance and complexity in Facebook's web applications.

. Problem Facebook Faced : The increasing complexity of Facebook's UI led to performance
 issues with traditional javascript and jQuery solutions.

. Solution: React introduced a novel approach called the Virtual DOM, which improved performance and
 allowed developers to think of their UI's as a tree of reusable components. 

. React was open-sourced in 2013 and has since become one of the most popular libraries for frontend development.


CORE Concepts of React :

1. Component-based Architecture: 
. React apps are built using components: small, reusable pieces of UI.
. Components can be functional or class-based.

2. Declarative programming :
. Instead of manually manipulating the DOM, developers define what the UI shouls look like, and react takes care 
of updating the DOM.

3. Virtual DOM: 
. React uses a lightweight, in-memory representation of the DOM(virtual DOM)
. When the state of component changes, react compares the virtual DOM with the real DOM and updates only the 
necessary parts.

4. JSX(Javascript XML):
. React uses a syntax extension called JSX, which allows HTML-like code to coexit with javascript logic.

5. Unidirectional Data flow: 
. React's data flow is one-way, making it easier to understand and debug applications.

6. State and Props:
. State: Represents the dynamic data of a component.
. Props: Allow Components to communicate with each other by passing data.



Why react is so popular?
. performance
. flexibility : used for building single page applcations (SPA), mobile apps, and even static sites.
. rich ecosystem
. community and support
. reusability
. backed bt meta
. cross-platform development
. SEO-friendly


ADVANTAGES: 
. learning curve: React is relatively easy to learn for developers familiar with javascript.
. rich tooling: developers tool like react devTools simplify debugging.
. scalability: suitable for both small and large-scale applcations.
. backward compatibility: updates rarely break backward compatibility, making upgrades smoohter.

2. react versions and why react
3. react vs next.js



                  Framework                                                 Library    
1. It comprises of lot of APIs, compilers,                  It is a collection of helper modules , classes ,                                                          objects , functions , pre-written code , etc.
   support programs, libraries etc.                           objects , functions , pre-written code , etc.

2. It is difficult to replace frameworks.	             A library is easy to be replaced with another library.   

3. A framework development requires a lot of              Building a library requires less code , so
 code that decrease performance and increase               there is better performance and fast load time.

 4. Including framework smoothly into an existing             Libraries can be integrated easily into existing projects
          project is impossible.                                      to add some specific functionality.

5. Its example are AngularJS , Spring , NodeJS , etc.                Its example are JQuery , React JS , etc.           





2.  react version is   19.0.0

React. js powers the digital platforms of Fortune 500 giants like Netflix, Facebook, Instagram,
 and Uber, showcasing its unmatched reliability and performance. This highly versatile library helps 
 businesses to create dynamic, interactive, and scalable web applications with ease.


3. NEXT.JS vs React :

next is a react framework built as an open-source on top of React library. 
It is created by vercel. Next framework creates fast search engine optimize
react applications with zero configuration. A traditional react application is 
rendered client-side where the browser starts with a shell of an HTML page lacking any
rendered content from which the browser extracts the JS file which consists of React files 
to display the content to the webpage. Next helps you create production-ready apps and provides
you the best experience with its features like server-side rendering, route pre-fetching, smart bundling, etc.

Features:
Hot Code Reloading
Automatic Code Splitting
Ecosystem Compatibility 
Server Rendering
Automatic Routing
